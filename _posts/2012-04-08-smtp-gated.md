## What is SMTP-Gated ?
    It is a server which have the ability to Scan, Recognize, and  Block Mails that Containing Spam or Viruses.

## How it works ?
    It acts like proxy, intercepting outgoing SMTP connections and scanning session data on-the-fly. When messages is infected, the SMTP session is terminated.

## Features:
    - Transparency â€“ is meant to be totally transparent for users, but stone-build for worms ðŸ˜‰
    - Message data is intercepted on-the-fly, and scanned just before acknowledged to SMTP server
    - Does not break AUTH, PIPELINING or STARTTLS (TLS without scanning)
    - Can block messages if AUTH is not used (optionally passing if AUTH is not supported by MSA)
    - Can insert source IP (pre-NAT) and ident* into message header
    - Can block any mail from infected hosts for defined time
    - Logging of MAIL FROM and RCPT TO (plain or as base64-ed MD5)
    - Logging of HELO/EHLO hostname
    - Can impose some limits on number of SMTP sessions: total, per IP, per ident*
    - Can reject connections when load exceeds some limit
    - Can skip spam-scanning if load is high
    - Executing user script on certain events
    - Scanning limited to messages up to configured size
    - Can be used to build scanning-farm for one or more routers*
    - Logs all connections via syslog
    - Has nifty status screen ðŸ˜‰
    - Message size limit (since 1.4.16-rc1)
    - Outgoing XCLIENT support (since 1.4.16-rc1)
    - Conditional content scanning depending on SMTP-AUTH status (since 1.4.16-rc1)
    - Regular expression (regex) conditions for HELO/MAIL FROM/RCPT TO (since 1.4.16-rc1)
    - SPF checking (since 1.4.16-rc1)

## Supports:
    ### Content scanning:
        - Clam AntiVirus daemon (clamd)
        - mksd â€“ daemonised version of mks_vir
        - SpamAssassin antispam scanning
    ### Access checking:
        - libpcre for HELO/MAIL FROM/RCPT TO regular expressions (not-)match
        - libspf2 for SPF (tested with debian libspf2 1.2.1)
    ### Uses various NAT frameworks (for standalone mode), or ident/proxy-helper* for external mode
        - patched ident daemon
        - proxy-helper daemon
        - netfilter framework of Linux
        - ipfw on FreeBSD
        - BSD/pf (packetfilter)
        - BSD/ipfilter
